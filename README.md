- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the first computer bug was actually a real bug?
                In 1947, a moth got trapped in a Harvard Mark II computer, causing it to malfunction.
                 Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, removed the bug and taped it to her logbook,
                  thus coining the term "debugging." 🐛
